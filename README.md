# CareerForge AI

An AI-powered career development platform: resume management, AI resume analysis (ATS
scoring, keyword/grammar analysis, skill gaps), JD matching, cover letter generation,
mock interview prep with AI feedback, learning roadmaps, and application tracking.

**Status**: Backend is fully complete (11 modules, 52 endpoints). Frontend is ~80%
complete and builds cleanly. See `ROADMAP.md` for the full continuation summary.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Auth**: JWT (access + rotating refresh tokens), httpOnly cookies
- **File storage**: Cloudinary (resume PDFs)
- **PDF parsing**: `pdf-parse`
- **AI**: Google Gemini (`@google/genai` SDK, `gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **Security**: helmet, express-rate-limit, express-mongo-sanitize, xss-clean, bcrypt
- **Validation**: express-validator
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI + CVA (shadcn/ui-style
  components), React Router, TanStack Query, Axios, React Hook Form + Zod, Framer Motion,
  Recharts, Lucide React, Sonner

## Getting Started

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values
npm run dev             # or: npm start
```

Health check: `GET /api/v1/health`

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_API_URL to your backend URL
npm run dev              # dev server on :5173
npm run build             # production build to dist/
```

### Required environment variables

**Backend** — see `backend/.env.example`. At minimum you need:
- `MONGO_URI` — MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` — long random strings
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Google AI Studio API key
- `EMAIL_*` — SMTP credentials for verification/reset emails

**Frontend** — see `frontend/.env.example`:
- `VITE_API_URL` — your backend's base API URL (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`)

> **Note on Gemini:** this project uses `@google/genai` (the current SDK) and
> `gemini-2.5-flash` (the current stable model). The older `@google/generative-ai`
> package and `gemini-1.5-flash` model are deprecated/shut down by Google and will not work.

## Architecture

Standard MVC on the backend, feature-folder React on the frontend:

## Deployment

- **Backend → Render**: `backend/render.yaml` is ready to use (Blueprint deploy). Set the
  `sync: false` env vars in the Render dashboard.
- **Frontend → Vercel**: `frontend/vercel.json` is ready (SPA rewrites configured). Set
  `VITE_API_URL` to your deployed backend URL in Vercel's project settings.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: create a cluster, allow-list Render's IPs (or `0.0.0.0/0` for
  simplicity), and use that connection string as `MONGO_URI`.
- **Cloudinary**: create a free account, use the dashboard's API credentials directly.
